# RotaryEncoder
Best Rotary Encoder Library for Arduino

I gathered pieces on the internet to build this Rotary Encoder library for Arduino. The code uses interrupt 0 to read the encoder's rotation direction correctly, software debounce, no step loss. Thank to Ralph S Bacon for his "#96 Rotary Encoder Update - Stepless & Software Debounced" video.
